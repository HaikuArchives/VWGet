Visual-WGet 0.8b

A visual version for GNU's wget for the BeOS.
by Santiago (=Jacques) Lema  (santiago.lema@cryogen.ch)

Requirements:
A PC with BeOS R4 and some RAM.

Known Bugs/Problems:
- Resuming broken downloads only works if file concerned is located in the directory vwget was launched from. This is the way wget works. we'll have to find a workaround.

- After a finished / aborted download , if you try to enter a new URL you'll get an error while downloading: URL not found... guess why?

For their help, greetings go to:
- Tyler Riti
- Alain Malek
